## System Requirements

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

Use the following commands to verify required tooling:

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Setup

- Chapter 4 consists of multiple "mini" projects. We recommend opening the specific folder for a project in your text editor and not the top-level parent folder containing all chapter projects.

### Client

```bash
npm install
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

## Running the project

### Client

```bash
npm start
```

### Server

- Run the following commands in a new terminal:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Running the tests

```bash
npm test
```
